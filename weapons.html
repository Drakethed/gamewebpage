        <h1>Axe (weapon type)</h1>
        <img src="/pics/weapons/ax.jpg" alt="Axes" class="pulse" />
        <p>
            Axes (斧, Ono?) are a recurring weapon type from the Final Fantasy series. They <br /> are usually two-handed weapons, meaning that a character cannot simultaneously use <br /> a shield. Axes are generally not as accurate as other weapons.

        <h1>Swords (weapon type)</h1>
        <img src="/pics/weapons/swords.jpg" alt="Swords" class="pulse" />
        <p>
            Swords (剣, Ken or Tsurugi?) are recurring weapons in the series, appearing in <br /> every game to date. The most proliferous weapon type in the original Final Fantasy <br /> and the starting weapon of Firion in Final Fantasy II, it has since
            become the weapon <br /> type of choice for lead protagonists in the series, with the notable exception of Zidane <br /> Tribal.
        </p>
        <h1>Katana (weapon type)</h1>
        <img src="/pics/weapons/katana.jpg" alt="Katana" class="pulse" />
        <p>
            Katana (刀, Katana?), also known as ninja swords, dark blades, and knife, is a type of<br /> weapon in many Final Fantasy games. The most prominent katana is the Masamune. Other <br /> recurring katana include: Kotetsu, Kikuichimonji, Ashura,
            Genji Blade and the Muramasa. <br /> Muramasa and Masamune are the two most powerful, though the Masamune is usually idolized<br /> as the strongest. The Murakumo and the Mutsunokami are two other katanas that are typically <br /> even stronger
            than the Masamune.

            are also used by other <br /> characters, such as Eiko Carol from Final Fantasy IX.
