        <h1>Jack</h1>
        <img src="/pics/Jack.jpg" alt="Jack" class="pulse" />
        <p>
            Jack is a playable character in Final Fantasy Type-0 who also appears in Final Fantasy <br /> Agito and Final Fantasy Awakening. He represents the number 11 of Class Zero and wields <br /> a katana. He is the "class clown" known for a lackadaisical
            attitude and slacking off <br /> during lectures, though there is more to him if one gets to know him better. To avoid <br /> himself and others being bogged down by despair, he tries to keep the mood light-hearted <br /> and crack jokes.
            He is the slowest playable character, and can't run when his weapon is <br /> drawn. However, his attacks are precise, strong and lightning-fast should his opponent <br /> be within his range. Jack is best used by studying the opponents' patterns
            and striking<br /> when there is a suitable opportunity.
        </p>

            or thinking <br /> ahead. He detests schoolwork, leading others to brand him as unintelligent, <br /> a label he protests. In battle he is a Dragoon archetype, a powerful melee <br /> character with good range and jump attacks with his spear.
