        <h1>Alexander</h1>
        <img src="/pics/summons/alexander.jpg" alt="Alexanger" class="pulse">
        <p>
            The name was one of the epithets given to the Greek goddess Hera and as such <br> is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". In the Iliad, the <br> character Paris is known also as Alexander. The name's popularity was spread<br>throughout
            the Greek world by the military conquests of King Alexander III, <br> commonly known as "Alexander the Great". Most later Alexanders in various countries <br> were directly or indirectly named after him
        </p>
        <h1>Bahamut</h1>
        <img src="/pics/summons/bahamut.jpg" alt="Bahamut" class="pulse">
        <p>
            Bahamut ZERO is a Summon Materia in Final Fantasy VII. It summons Bahamut ZERO,<br> the strongest of the Bahamut strains, above Bahamut and Neo Bahamut. Bahamut ZERO<br> performs Tera Flare, a non-elemental attack that deals immense damage
            to all <br> opponents and ignores their Magic def.
        </p>
        <h1>Ifrit</h1>
        <img src="/pics/summons/ifrit.jpg" alt="Ifrit" class="pulse">
        <p>
            Ifrit has also been called Jinn. The jinn, also spelled djinn, or genies, <br> are spirits mentioned in the Qurʾān and Islamic theology who inhabit an unseen <br> world in dimensions beyond the visible universe of humans. Together, the jinn,<br>            humans and angels make up the three sentient creations of God. The Hell Fire attack<br> draws reference to the Jinn Shaitan (Satan)'s role in Islamic thought, as the Holy<br> Qu-ran describes him as refusing to prostrate himself before mankind
            due to believing <br> that he -as a creature of fire- was superior to humanity.
        </p>
        <h1>Leviathan</h1>
        <img src="/pics/summons/leviathan.jpg" alt="Leviathan" class="pulse">
        <p>
            late 14c., "sea monster, sea serpent," sometimes regarded as a form of Satan,<br> from Late Latin leviathan, from Hebrew livyathan "dragon, serpent, huge sea <br> animal," of unknown origin, perhaps from root l-w-h- "to wind, turn, twist,"
            <br> on the notion of a serpent's coils. If so, related to Hebrew liwyah "wreath," <br> Arabic lawa "to bend, twist." Of powerful persons or things from c. 1600. <br> Hobbes's use is from 1651. An aquatic animal mentioned in the Old Testament.
            <br> It is described in Job xli. apparently as a crocodile; in Isa. xxvii 1 it is <br> called a piercing and a crooked serpent; and it is mentioned indefinitely in <br> Ps. lxxiv. 14 as food and Ps. civ. 26.
        </p>
        <h1>odin</h1>
        <img src="/pics/summons/odin.jpg" alt="Odin" class="pulse">
        <p>
            Odin is a widely revered god in Germanic mythology. Norse mythology, the source of <br> most surviving information about him, associates him with wisdom, healing, death, <br> royalty, the gallows, knowledge, war, battle, victory, sorcery,
            poetry, frenzy, and <br> the runic alphabet, and depicts him as the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider <br> Germanic mythology and paganism, the god was known in Old English as Wōden, in Old <br> Saxon as Uuôden, in Old Dutch as Wuodan,
            in Old Frisian as Wêda, and in Old High <br> German as Wuotan, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Wōđanaz,<br> meaning 'lord of frenzy', or 'leader of the possessed'.
        </p>
        <h1>Ramuh</h1>
        <img src="/pics/summons//ramuh.jpg" alt="Ramuh" class="pulse">
        <p>
            Ramuh could be based on Lahmu, who is often portrayed as a bearded man with a <br> red sash and four to six curls on his head. Ramuh could also be loosely based on <br> an epic Hindu poem, written by Valmiki, called Ramayana. Its protagonist
            is Raama <br> (also spelled Rama), said to have been the incarnation of the Hindu god, Vishnu. <br> The name Ramuh could be an amalgam of Raama and Vishnu.
        </p>
        <h1>Shiva</h1>
        <img src="/pics/summons/shiva.jpg" alt="Shiva" class="pulse">
        <p>
            One of the three supreme gods of Hinduism, lord of destruction and reproduction, <br> 1788, from Hindi Shiva, from Sanskrit Sivah, literally "propitious, gracious," <br> from PIE *ki-wo-, suffixed form of root *kei- (1) "to lie," also forming
            words for <br> "bed, couch," and with a secondary sense of "beloved, dear." But by some this <br> name is said to be a euphemism.
